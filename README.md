# Deploying a locked Firefox

How to deploy a copy of Firefox with a locked "about:config"

## Prerequisites

I recommend uninstalling or quarintining all other installations of Firefox if you are planning to use this guide for a kiosk or as the main browser in an enterprise environment. 

## Installing
### Debian/Ubuntu
Run the installer from the command line:
```
./debianInstaller.sh
```

###Mac
Run the installer from the command line:
```
./macInstaller.sh
```
